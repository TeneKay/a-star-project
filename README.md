# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

> Made using PyGame, requires PyGame to be installed. `pip install pygame`

# What is this?
A small program I made during my 2019 Christmas break from University. Used online resources such as Computerphile and Sebastian Lague's youtube channel to understand the algorithm itself.

# What does it do?
It allows you to create a grid (of custom size or default size 20x20) and place/remove obstacles and run the A* Algorithm.

Controls are as follows:
- Click to place/remove obstacles
- Space to run A* Algorithm
- Escape to refresh / re-randomize the end/start node spawn points

Time taken: about 5-10h total, including bug-fixing and watching explanation on how the algorithm works.
